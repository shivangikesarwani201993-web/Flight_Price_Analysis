✈️ Flight PriceData Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing flight price data to uncover key factors that influence airfare rates. The dataset includes details such as airline, source, destination, route, departure and arrival times, duration, number of stops, and ticket prices.
🔍 Objective:
To explore and understand how different features — like airline, travel duration, number of stops, and travel time — impact the ticket prices.
📊 Key Steps:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, formatting dates, etc.)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize flight trends and price patterns.
3. Feature engineering (extracting journey day, month, duration hours, etc.)
4. Correlation and statistical analysis of price drivers
💡Insights Gained:
1. Airlines and number of stops are major factors affecting prices
2. Non-stop flights generally cost more than connecting ones
3. Certain routes show consistent variations in fares
